# EXPENSE TRACKER

## Overview

This Erasmus Expense Tracker is a simple yet technically robust Python project designed to track monthly expenses and income using a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter. The project leverages file handling with CSV, user input validation, and a structured GUI to provide an intuitive experience while managing financial records.

This application was developed last year while studying abroad on Erasmus, primarily as a personal tool to monitor expenses and budget effectively. Despite its simplicity, the project integrates Python programming, data handling, and GUI development.

## Features

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using Tkinter for an interactive and easy-to-use experience.

- Expense & Income Tracking: Add new income and expenses, categorized by month and year.

- Data Persistence: Stores financial data in a structured CSV file for easy access and modification.

- Expense Management:

  - View total income and expenses for a given month.

  - Delete specific expenses by unique ID.

  - Calculate monthly balance (Income - Expenses).

- Error Handling & Validation: Ensures correct month and year input, prevents invalid entries.

## Technical Highlits

- File Handling with CSV: Persistent storage and retrieval of financial records.

- Object-Oriented & Functional Programming: A clean and modular approach to structuring the code.

- Tkinter for GUI Development: Creating interactive buttons, input dialogs, and message popups.

- View total income, total expenses and balance
- List all expenses
- Delete expenses

## Future Improvements
- Database Integration: Replace CSV storage with SQLite or PostgreSQL for better data management.

- Advanced UI Enhancements: Improve aesthetics with a more modern GUI framework such as PyQt or Tkinter themes.

- Data Visualization: Add graphs and charts to visualize spending trends.

- Export & Reporting: Allow exporting financial summaries as PDF or Excel files.
